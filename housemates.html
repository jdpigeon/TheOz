	<h3>Dano</h3>
	<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/dano.jpg" alt="" /></span>Dano recently graduated with a MSc. in Neurophysiology from the U of T and has gotten himself a job in tech. He's building an Android app that will teach users about EEG signal processing by displaying their own brain signals to them in real time. Generally, the intersection between neuroscience and tech is where Dano wants to be.</p>
	<p>Dano enjoys brewing beer, skiing, hiking and playing the occasional video game (curr: Civ VI and Overwatch). He also sings and plays ukulele and guitar, sometimes at odd hours of the day. Enjoys gardening but does not have a green thumb. Cycles everywhere.</p>
